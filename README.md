# README #

This repository contains a set of quick guides to deploy and share your AI models on [SeeMe.ai](https://seeme.ai), the AI marketplace.

We are building the tools for you to easily **train, use and share AI models** for fun and profit.

SeeMe.ai is currently in development and things might break.

For the beta period, 

- you can host one model with up to 1000 predictions for free;
- We are working on a fair and sustainable pricing (contact iwantto@seeme.ai for more info);
- We rely on your code of honor for fair use.
